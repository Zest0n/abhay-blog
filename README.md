# Becoming the Man My Bloodline Was Waiting For

There wasn’t a single moment that changed everything — it was slow, messy, and personal.  
I wasn’t always the kid who wanted to compete. In fact, there was a time when I thought the people who topped charts or cracked Olympiads were born different.  
Smarter. Sharper. Untouchable.

Then I got curious.

And curiosity is dangerous — it doesn’t let you settle. I started noticing how people around me thought. How they *learned*. How they connected dots I didn’t even know existed. Their minds felt like wild galaxies and I just wanted a small telescope to peek inside. So, I tried harder. I paid attention. I made mistakes. And I kept going.

Eventually, I reached a point I now call "threshold knowledge" — just enough to start *creating* new knowledge. Whether it was a pattern in sequences or a gap in a concept, I could feel ideas forming. It was addictive. The kind of rush that makes you forget time.

That’s when I found out about **KAIST** — through comics at first, weirdly enough.  
Then forums. Blogs. Seniors who wrote about it like it was sacred ground for the curious. I thought, "That’s it. That’s the place."  
The dream felt far. Maybe even generational. But I kept reading. And eventually, I decided I wanted to try.

### The India Problem

Here, everything is IIT or nothing. And while I respect that grind, the narrow tunnel vision kills so many dreams. I didn’t even know schools like KAIST *existed* until I went looking beyond the usual paths. The internet became my teacher. And now — here I am. Building a portfolio. Writing this. Taking the shot.

### My First Big Project

I’m working on something that feels both fun and intense —  
An open-source **Memory Allocator** for a low-end gaming engine. I want to understand how memory works from the inside out. No shortcuts. Just raw logic. Manual allocations. Deep systems knowledge. A little madness.

Why? Because I’ve always loved computers.  
Because some kid out there might need this allocator someday.  
Because understanding the 0s and 1s is my version of enlightenment.

### Inspirations That Fuel Me

- **Beej Jorgensen** — his free C guides felt like a gift.
- **David Goggins** — discipline on a different level.
- **Alex Hormozi** — real about failing, and still rising.
- **Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam** — a vision beyond generations.
- **Sundar Pichai** — walked the path I dream of.

And all the anonymous people online whose words and code taught me when no one else did.

### Why This Blog Exists

This isn’t about going viral or pretending I know it all.  
This blog is a journal. A mirror. A small record of the quiet war I fight every day — to learn, to understand, to become someone my future self won’t just respect… but *recognize*.

If you're reading this and you’ve ever felt behind — know that I did too.  
We’re just getting started.
